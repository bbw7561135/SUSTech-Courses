-- The same string_agg() is particularly useful for

-- Several things to notice: like all group functions, string_agg()
-- ignore nulls (and can be used as a window function).
-- Multiple aggregates (on different sources) are usually tricky.
-- I managed to aggregate directors and actors in a single pass because
-- the information comes from the same tables, and I could use case to
